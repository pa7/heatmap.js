# Angular2 Heatmap.js Example

#### As till now heatmap.js officially don't support angular2
its a work around if you want to use heatmap.js in your angular2 project

Requirements :

- Add `<script src="https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/assets/js/heatmap.min.js"></script>` in your index.html file.

A contribution to heatmap.js is not a plugin. If you want to contribute a plugin a similar workflow applies but you don't have to run the watcher (because it won't go into the build).

### Checkout repository

### Install

`npm install`

### Create a new feature branch

### Add new file to watcher

If you're introducing a new file you'll have to add it to the `package.json` 's buildFiles

### Run watcher

`grunt`

### Add your code

### Add an example/tests

### Create pull request

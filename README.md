## How to get started

The fastest way to get started is to install heatmap.js with bower. Just run the following command:

`bower install heatmap.js-amd`

This will download the latest working version of heatmap.js and put it in your bower_components folder.

Alternatively you could just download [the latest release](https://github.com/pa7/heatmap.js/releases) from github and unzip it.


The file you're ultimately looking for is **heatmap.js** or **heatmap.min.js**



heatmap.js is also hosted on npm:

`npm install heatmap.js`



### How to run the local examples

Start a webserver (e.g. python SimpleHTTPServer from the project directory root):

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337 &`

Then browse to 

`http://localhost:1337/examples/`
